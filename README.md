# Ritchie-Kernighan_examples
Some C exercises based on Rithcie &amp; Kernighan' s "The C Language Programming"

This is kind of mid way between learning C and organizing my katas around some general concepts.

Folders
=======
Numbered folders can be found. Numbers follow cronological order inside Ritchies&Kernighan's book. Otherwise, titles doesen't necessary correspond book ones. They act more like tags than propper titles.

Unfoldered files
================

- `README` is this file you are reading right now. 
- `leeme.org` is kind of mixed log file and spanish written *readme*. It's in emacs `org-mode` using babel, and the entire project can be generated from the file if it's opened in emacs itself.
